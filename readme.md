# PSA VAN-CAN protocol bridge (hardware)

### What is it ?
This is the hardware needed for my [PSA VAN-CAN protocol bridge][psavancanbridge] software.

The files are created with KiCad. 

The master branch contains only this readme file as the boards themselves are pretty much different and having a continuous history does not really make sense. 
So every revision has its own branch. They are in the state as I sent them to the manufacturing company.

You might ask that where are the missing versions like v1.2. and v1.3 Well... those versions where faulty revisions. So I decided not to upload them. This way nobody will build them by mistake.

### Available revisions

- [Rev 1.0][version_10] (Actually this revision is not supported by the software, this is uploaded for historical reasons)
- [Rev 1.1][version_11]
