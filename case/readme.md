# PSA VAN-CAN protocol bridge (hardware) 3D printed case

### 3D printed case model
This is the 3D model for PSAVanCanBridge adapter in minimal hardware configuration.
Model contains two files:
- cap.stl
- body.stl

Cap is just press connection. For PCB mount I used M2.5x8 screws.

### Print details

I printed this on cheap chinese Ender 3 printer. Material is Devil Design PETG. Hotend temperature 230°C, table 70°C.
